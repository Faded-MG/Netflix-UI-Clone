We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services (which may include maintaining and improving their services). To help maintain the safety and security of our service and users, we and our Service Providers may monitor and record message content (such as chat functionality) to identify harmful behavior, security risks, and violations of the Netflix Terms of Use and community guidelines.

</ul>
<h3>International Transfers of Personal Information
</h3>
<p> Netflix operates from various countries around the world, as do its Service Providers, Partners, and other third parties to whom we may need to disclose your personal information, as described above. This means that when you use or interact with Netflix, your personal information may be transferred to other countries that have different data protection laws than those where you reside.
</p>
<p>
However, whenever we transfer personal information to other countries, we ensure that the personal information is transferred in accordance with applicable data protection laws and this Privacy Statement. Specifically, we use a variety of contractual, technical, and organizational measures as appropriate for such transfers, including data protection agreements, technical protections, and practices to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests. You can find out more about how we disclose and transfer your personal information internationally here: help.netflix.com/legal/personal-information-international-transfers.
</p>
<h3>Supplemental Privacy Disclosures</h3>
<p>
We provide supplemental information regarding certain aspects of the Netflix service (such as certain Netflix games features) in the section “Supplemental Privacy Disclosures for Certain Services” below.
</p>
<h2 id="B" style="text-decoration: underline";>Section B: Your Rights and Controls</h2>
<h3>
Your Privacy Rights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Access, correct, update, or delete your personal information: You have a right to confirm whether we process your personal information and to access and receive a copy of the personal information we process about you. You may also correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information or request that we delete personal information that we hold about you.
</li>
<p>
To request a copy of your personal information, please visit netflix.com/account/getmyinfo. In addition, under the "Account" section of our website, you can access and update information about your account, including your contact information, payment information, and various related information about your account. You must be logged in to access the "Account" section.
</p>
<p>
For information about deletion, removal, and retention of personal information, please see: help.netflix.com/node/100625.
</p>
<li>Portability and downloading a copy of your personal information: You can request portability of or download a copy of your personal information. If you are the account owner, to download a copy of your personal information go to: netflix.com/account/getmyinfo. For more information, please see: help.netflix.com/node/100624.</li>
<li>Objection, restriction, and withdrawal of consent: You can object to or request that we restrict processing of your personal information. If we have collected and are processing your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. For more information, please see help.netflix.com/node/100637.</li>
<li>Right to complain: You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our processing of your personal information but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.</li>
<li>Right not to be subject to automated decision making: You may have a right not to be subject to a decision made solely using automated means, where such decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can exercise the rights described above when we receive a verified request in accordance with applicable law.
</p>

<h3>Communication and Marketing Preferences
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Email and Text Messages. If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, please access the “Notification settings” option for the relevant profile within the “Account” section of our website. Alternatively, click the “unsubscribe” link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message (note: you may receive a confirmation text message in this case). Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from transactional messages from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.</li>
<li>Push Notifications. You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. Netflix will send you push notifications from time to time in accordance with any notification preferences you have set on your mobile device. If you later decide you no longer want to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device’s settings to turn them off (or via the “Notification settings” described in the preceding section). Please note that individual Netflix games may have their own push notifications (you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off). We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and later decide you no longer want to receive them, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off.</li>
<li>Matched Identifier Communications from Netflix. Some third party services allow us to reach users with online marketing about Netflix content or the Netflix service by sending privacy protected contact information to the third party. Privacy protected contact information means we use pseudonymization technologies (such as hashing) to convert the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) that cannot, by itself, reveal your identity or contact information. The third party compares Netflix’s privacy protected contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be a match only if you have used the same contact information with both Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing. You can indicate your choices regarding the Matched Identifier Communications in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant profile) within the “Account” section of our website.</li>

<li>Marketing of the Netflix service using cookies and similar technologies. To exercise choice around cookies or resettable device IDs collected for marketing of the Netflix service or Netflix content on third party service, please use the tools described in the “Cookies and other Technologies” section below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advertising Choices
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Behavioral Advertising Choices
</li>
<p>
We respect your behavioral advertising preferences, and you can turn off behavioral advertisements at any time by changing the “Behavioral Advertising” setting located in the “Privacy and data settings” menu (for the relevant profile) of the “Account” section of our website.
</p>
<p>
If your behavioral advertisements setting is off, you will still see Advertisements, but they will be non-behavioral advertisements.
</p>
<p>
An option to opt out is not provided in a Kids profile because we do not engage in behavioral advertising on Kids profiles.
</p>

<li>Digital Advertising Alliance Opt Out Control
</li>

<p>Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for behavioral advertising:
</p>
<ul>

<li>In Canada: AdChoices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)</li>
<li>In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Contact and Questions</h3>
<p>
If you want to exercise any of your rights, or have a question regarding our privacy practices, please contact our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office at privacy@netflix.com.
</p>
<h2 id="C" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Section C: Access to Account and Profiles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sharing your account with others: As a Netflix member, if you share your account with others in your household, please ensure that they are aware of and have read this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement applies to their use of Netflix (except sections that only apply to the member, such as those related to payments). Please note that the member controls the Netflix account and all profiles, the information in the account and all profiles, and whether to share (or stop sharing) the account with individuals in their household.
</li>

<p>If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they may be able to see viewing information, account information in the “Account” section of the service, and game related information such as chat contents and saved game information. This remains true even when you use the profiles feature, although you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile (see help.netflix.com/node/114277). Please note that viewing history, recommendations, “continue watching” and similar information may be made available through various features and user experiences, such as Partner interfaces that are integrated with the Netflix service.
</p>
<li>Profiles: Profiles allow users on a Netflix account to have a personalized Netflix experience, built around the Netflix content of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles, and information within or associated with the profile (although, as noted above, you can add a Profile Lock PIN on a profile). You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not want them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number, or other information to the profile and will be provided with a notice at the time such information is provided (the “Profile Privacy Notice” applies – see help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy). We also have various parental controls available and you can learn more here: help.netflix.com/node/264.</li>
<li>Profile Transfers: The profile transfer feature on your account allows you and users with access to your account to transfer an eligible profile from your account to a separate account (including information such as viewing history and recommendations). You can change the setting for this feature in the “Account” section of our website. You can learn more here: help.netflix.com/node/122698.</li>
<li>Account Login Features: You may have the option to use certain account login features, such as email-based or text message-based login, or easier login to the Netflix app on certain devices. Please note that any device that is logged into your account will remain logged in unless you log out of those devices (following the instructions in the section below).</li>
<li>Removing device access to your Netflix account: To remove access to your Netflix account from devices that are logged into the account, visit the “Account” section of our website, locate the “Sign out of all devices” option, and follow the instructions to sign out of your devices. Users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each session. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, be sure to first log out. If you or other users on the account do not maintain the security of your email address, password, and signed-in devices, or fail to log out a device you sell or return, then others may be able to access your Netflix account, including your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="D" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Section D: Cookies and other Technologies</h2>

<p>We, our Service Providers, Netflix Marketing Providers, and Advertising Companies use cookies, other similar technologies (such as pixel tags), hashed identifiers, and resettable device identifiers for various reasons. This section explains the types of technologies used, what they do, and your corresponding choices. To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below “How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?”
</p>

<h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies, Pixel Tags, Hashed Identifiers, and Resettable Device Identifiers
</h3>
<p>Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server.
</p>
<p>
We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies.
</p>
<p>
We may also create, use, and disclose hashed identifiers. As described above, hashing is a process of converting the original contact information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) that cannot, by itself, reveal your identity or contact information.
</p>
<p>
If you use a Netflix app (such as the main Netflix app, or a Netflix game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the “Identifier for Advertisers” on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
</p>

<h3>Why Does Netflix Use These Technologies?
</h3>
<p>
    We use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and improve our services (for example, to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example, to deliver and tailor our marketing, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and marketing on third party services); to support Advertisements; for safety, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce the Netflix Terms of Use. These technologies enable Netflix Marketing Providers to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit and device and network information) when you use our services, and Netflix Marketing Providers may also collect information about your online activities over time across different websites.
</p>
<p>
We use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our service. Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked, or the emails are opened.
</p>
<p>
Netflix uses hashed identifiers and resettable device identifiers to display marketing for our service or Netflix content on third party services, to support Advertisements (including delivering Advertisements to you), and for analytics and optimization purposes.

<h3>How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?
</h3>
<ul>
    
<li>To exercise choice regarding cookies
</li>
<p>
For more information about cookies set through our service and to exercise choices regarding cookies, click here. We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track" signals.

<li>
To exercise choice regarding hashed identifiers for Netflix Marketing
</li>
<p>
To exercise choice regarding Netflix’s use of hashed identifiers for Netflix marketing communications on third party services, please configure the appropriate setting under Matched Identifier Communications in the "Privacy and data settings" (for the relevant profile) within the "Account" section of our website.
</p>
<li>
To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers
</li>
<p>
To exercise choice regarding Netflix’s use of resettable device identifiers (for marketing the Netflix service or Netflix content, or as used to support Advertisements), please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under "privacy" or "ads" in your device settings). If you choose not to allow this, you may still see marketing messages promoting Netflix and Advertisements on that device but it will not be selected based on the use of a resettable device identifier. Note that your choice regarding the resettable device identifier is specific to that device.
</p>

<li>To exercise choice regarding other similar technologies
</li>

<p>
In addition to any choices we may offer you in the Netflix service, there are several ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, typically in the settings or preferences area. See your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Most email clients have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including pixel tags, and the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images. Other technologies may be cleared from within the application.
</p>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these choices, if you want to exercise your choices for behavioral advertising on Netflix, please see “Advertising Choices” above.
